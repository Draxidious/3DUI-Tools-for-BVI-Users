# 3DUI-Tools-for-BVI-Users

This project is a novel implementation of XR tools for blind users, which is an under-researched area of XR. XR can leverage cutting edge technology to enhance the ability for blind users to understand the world around them. In this project, we explore various tools that can allow blind users to better understand their 3D environment. 

In order to evaluate the potential effectiveness of these tools, 3 tasks were created for a blind user to navigate:
1. A task requiring the user to interact with various objects
2. A task requiring the user to interact with 2D UIs in 3D space
3. A task requiring the user to find their way through a maze.
